# Available Link: https://usersearchhistory.herokuapp.com/
This is an ongoing project. Not completed yet. After completion, screenshots will be provided

# Problem Statement: 
Create an ORM Data Model in Django for User Search History in an imagined Search Engine. Could be Google, who knows :P You can store anything[fields] you want. Like, search keyword, which used searched, what time.. What results came after searching.. etc.. Add as many fields as you like. 

Dump those results in a view[html/css] and add some filters like, 
Keywords with count, user , time range with checkbox. Imagine it like this

All Keywords:
[ ] Keyword 1 (20 times found)
[ ]  Keyword 2 (12 times found)
[ ]  Keyword 3 (8 times found)

All Users:
[ ] User 1
[ ] User 2
[ ] User 3

Time Range:
[ ] See data from yesterday
[ ] See data from last week
[ ] see data from last month 

Select Date:
[ Enter start date]
[ Enter end date ]

More filters:
[ ]
[ ]

Note: [ ] those are checkboxes I mean. 

If I select any of those checkboxes, results will be filtered using some JS, without reloading the page. If I select multiple checkboxes, results will be filtered based on that.
